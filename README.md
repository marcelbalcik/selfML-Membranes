# selfML-Membranes
This project provides a modular, extensible machine learning pipeline to predict gas permeabilities of polymer membranes based on structural, processing, and molecular fingerprint features. It is designed to enable research labs to evaluate predictive models using their own curated datasets. If you find the available ML papers in the field to have flaws, that is usually due to the data. Before starting, you should have membrane physical and gas permeability data.


Kind of a placeholder until the work is published.
